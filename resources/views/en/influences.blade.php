                    A relationship overview enhances a conversation with a unique visual and spatial communication.
                    Seeing a relationship overview can help to clarify and simplify situations that a person has experienced as confusing and chaotic.
                    It can help a family make more sense out of a dilemma they are facing.

                    <br>

                    Figure arrangements provide spatial overviews of social relationships which provide additional perspective for considering their situation and understanding each other.
                    The communication is direct and the visual information it brings gives increased clarity to the verbal conversation.

                  <br>

                    Because visual and spatial expressions of this kind are unusual, particularly for adults, they provide fresh information about a situation.
                    How the figures are placed invites curiosity about the point of view of the person represented, and creates interest in hearing more about what they are expressing and why.
                    When talking with groups and families, people show each other an expression of how they view their relationships, and this will support a dialogical form of conversation.

                <p   data-aos="fade-right"  data-aos-duration="1700" class="text">

                People look at a relationship overview from a position a short distance away and slightly above.
                It is a kind of bird's eye view and a colleague of mine referred to this as being in an elevated position that combines observation and participation.
                This is the visual and emotional distance of surveying from the above, together with the personal, emotional intensity of knowing that this is about my life and the people I know and care about.
                The well-known expression ‘Not being able to see the wood for the trees’ has relevance here, as a relationship overview can elevate a person’s gaze from being within the ‘trees’ so that they see a representation of their ‘social woodland'.
                It gives them the impression of looking onto their situation, at the same time as they retain their subjective experiences - a duality of perspective.

                <br>

                This surveying position, a kind of participant observation in the conversation, can sharpen awareness of the content, scope and connections of the various aspects of the relationships.
                A surveying position allows talking about the contents of a person’s relationships as they are drawn to see and reflect over the thoughts and opinions they have concerning their situation.
                Questions arise about which people belong together and which do not, and how they are involved.They can be invited to consider how the situation would look from another point of view.
                The person arranging figures will be exploring their own understandings as well as demonstrating their perspectives.

                <p   data-aos="fade-left"  data-aos-duration="1700"  class="text" >

                Figures can easily be moved, rearranged to compare and contrast different perceptions which makes genograms and network maps flexible, a big advantage over drawing these.
                    <br>

                    Mobility is an essential element of dialogue as there is a continuing to-and-fro, from one to the other, which requires a positive energy and engagement.
                    There is an expectation that differences of perspective will be brought up and aired respectfully
                    <br>

                    Talking about a difficulty in the same way in which it was formed will be unlikely to create movement, so present understandings have to be challenged and alternative perspectives brought to the fore.
                    In a dialogue there is a potential for development for all participants when a situation is viewed in a new way that is both acceptable to them and that they can act upon.

                  <br>

                    A single arrangement of figures is quite static and there is a risk that the arrangement can be understood as a true representation of a person’s reality.
                    This can contribute to leaving the family more stuck in their thinking if a therapist stops with just one view of a situation.

                <p   data-aos="fade-right"  data-aos-duration="1700"  class="text">

                    Using figures provides a conversation with a visual point of focus.
                    The person setting out the relationship overview devotes a lot of their attention to the figures and to the arrangement, less to the others in the room.
                    The attention of others is directed both at the person setting out the figures and at arrangement.
                    This division of attention can relieve pressure on the person talking, as they are not the only centre of attention.
                    Several therapists I have interviewed pointed out that using figures gives a conversation a clearer structure.
                    Having something visual and concrete to talk about helps children to talk about themselves and their situations more easily


                    <br>


                    It also helped to get the conversation going, gave direction to the therapist’s questions and led quickly to issues that were important to talk about.
                    "When the relationship overview helped to get the conversation going and led quickly onto important issues, it was not the position of the figures that was of primary importance, it was the dialogue concerning the placements that was of therapeutic value. Picking up on the relevance of how the figures are placed and using this to explore the various understandings and possibilities makes using them therapeutic."


                    <br>

                    A relationship overview is a simple, ordered expression of relationships, and this structure can help to clarify and simplify a situation that the person has experienced as chaotic.
                    This clarification can free perspectives that have become rigid and stuck.
                    It may challenge the therapist, who also has to divide their attention between the overview, the person talking and the others in the room.

                            Using figures to form a relationship overview is an active form of communication.
                            The figures are concrete and practical, and a person is bodily engaged in the conversation through purposeful movement.
                            A relationship overview is a creative activity and there is often a strong element of playfulness about using figures in conversation even though it is not a game.
                            There is enactment, the conversation is performed and carried out.
                            Other people present also become engaged and usually watch in the same way as spectators of a game or sport, eager to participate themselves.


                            <br>


                             The person setting out the figures can experience a sense of achievement when they see their relationship overview.
                            The result can be surprising as aspects come forward that they had overlooked or had not previously considered.
                            Picking up figures and moving them involves the sense of touch and purposeful bodily movement as well as seeing and hearing, and there can be a synergistic effect from actively involving several senses.

                            A relationship overview is literally between the people involved in the conversation.
                            This enhances an understanding that difficulties in relationships are best seen as between the people involved, rather than within them.
                            Generally speaking, there is more room for flexibility in finding ways of resolving conflicts when considering them as between people rather than as a result of the nature of individuals.
                            In a social network there are often people with a greater degree of connectedness and influence than others.
                            This is related to betweenness as a mathematical concept, which describes the centrality of nodes in a matrix.

                Looking at a relationship overview gives fresh information on perceptions of relationships.
                With a couple, family, or group, one person will often gain a direct insight into another’s perceptions and the conversation about this will enhance their understanding.
                It is quite usual for parents to express surprise at the way their children understand things as they often overlook how differently they process information.
                An arrangement of figures is an unusual expression of a person’s social reality.

                It has an element of revelation for the person setting it out as well as anybody observing.
                This is because they probably have not done this before and have no idea what it will look like until they have formed it.
                As they are in a surveying position, they will have plenty of opportunity to reflect over the sight of it.
                Because the various relationships are shown in context with each other there is plenty of new information to take stock of.

                    The novelty of making a relationship overview gives a conversation a high degree of spontaneity.
                    It is an unprepared, innovative expression that belongs to the here-and-now.

                                Using figures involves positioning and there is always room for movement which enhances the idea that situations can be understood in a variety of ways and that differing points of view and opinions can have relevance and validity.
                                It is a good idea to consider alternative arrangements of figures to encourage cognitive flexibility and increased mentalising.
                                There is also a multiplicity of ways of using relationship overviews, as they are not tied to a particular theoretical position and can be used in a variety of professional settings.

                    Using figures is a highly reflective form of conversation where people are continually invited to take
                    stock of their own point of view, attitudes and opinions and consider alternatives, not least their
                    understanding of the thoughts and feelings of others.

                                Relationship overviews are good at revealing power relationships for individuals, families and groups and can shift focus towards the dynamics of change so that a person’s energy is focused constructively.
                                Overviews of relationships can help people to review their understanding of alliances, values and resources when considering whether to make changes.
                                The increased awareness of the power and influence they can have, together with the people around them, lead to discussing themes like resources, opportunity, network, support, agency, power and collaboration.
