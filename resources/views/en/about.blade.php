              The website was created by Steven Balmbra, a family and group therapist based in Bodø, Norway.  He has used figures and objects in his work for over 30 years.

                Steven was born in London, trained as a psychiatric nurse and obtained a bachelor's degree in applied social psychology at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology in Cardiff.

                At the Hill End Adolescent Unit he was introduced to group and family therapy.  In 1983 he moved to Bodø, his wife's hometown, and was employed at the newly established Youth Department at BUPA, NPS.

                Since then has worked at the family department, BUP, the psychosis team and the regional center for eating disorders, and at the Bodø family protection office.

                He has completed further education in family therapy, child psychotherapy, psychodrama, multi-family therapy, mentalisation-based therapy, cognitive therapy and guidance and has a master's degree in practical knowledge at Nord University. He retired in 2021.

                  "When I started working at the Family Department at Nordlandssykehuset in 1987, I struggled to find a way to talk to parents and children together. In conversations with families, the younger children often became either sullen and withdrawn or overactive and "disturbing". Eventually I realized that we communicated like adults, using only words. I imagined the words swarming over the children's heads, difficult to understand and easy to misinterpret, and I worried that we were adding to their confusion and doing more harm than good.

                    I read the article 'Redressing the balance - involving children in family therapy' by Alison O'Brien and Penny Loudon in the Journal of Family Therapy (JoFT 1985 v7.2 81-88). The article described the dilemma I was facing and suggested several ways to use drawings and objects to include children in family conversations.

                    In 1988, the family department began supervising American family therapist Harry Goolishian. He had developed the Problem Systems Approach (now known as collaborative therapy) with Harlene Anderson and colleagues at the Houston Galveston Institute.

                    This approach meant taking into account family members and other people who were part of defining a "stuck" situation.

                    Then a colleague showed me a set of wooden figures that the Norwegian family therapist David Kvebæk had developed for working with families.

                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <p class="small-header">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <h2>  The Family Dialogue Set was born</h2>
                    <hr>


                    I realized that if I was going to use figures in accordance with this approach I would have to have quite a wide variety and I assembled a set of Playmobil figures.

                    Sometimes I played board games with the families at the Family Unit, and I had a board made for younger children to place their pieces on to make communication a little easier for them. I used the shapes to facilitate dialogue rather than assessment, and I didn't want a grid so the board was based on hexagons that bordered each other equally.

                    At the Youth Department, we had used social network diagrams to talk to young people about their situation.  I had a board made with some kind of network map and started using the figures instead of drawing symbols for people. Because the figures were easy to move around, the conversations about the social networks became more flexible and adapted to look for alternative perspectives.

                    Then I started using figures to set up genograms to help parents tell their children about their extended family.

                    Other systemic approaches also influenced our work, such as circular questioning, problem externalization and solution focus, and I supplemented the figure set with various objects, drawings and symbols to accommodate these.

                    <br><br>
                    The different perspectives of all the family members became clearer, and we usually arrived at key relationship issues quite quickly so that we could talk about them in a constructive way. The figures gave structure and direction to the dialogue. Words and pictures worked together to improve communication and engage the whole family. Elements of playfulness and humor were often present even in discussion of difficult issues, and this tended to loosen rigid positions and promote more constructive attitudes to questions of how to move forward.
                    After a couple of years of using my figure set, I realized that it would also benefit other family therapists, and I decided to produce it for sale. I glued the Playmobil figures onto round bases and placed them in wooden trays for display. I included "magic figures", pets, pens, thought bubbles and plasticine and put everything in a case for easy transport. I wrote user guides and called it the Family Dialogue Set to emphasize it as a conversation tool, rather than a test. Produced between 1991 and 2011, it was acquired by child and family mental health departments, child welfare agencies and educational support services in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

                Although there is great potential in integrating figures and objects in dialogue about relationships, this is not something that is obvious in itself.

                In 2004, I conducted a survey of therapists who used the Family Dialogue Set and analyzed their responses to gain a closer understanding of how figures can be used and how they influence conversations.  I wrote a report but did not publish it.

                Later, when there was still very little written about this, I gathered information from the report, feedback from families and my own experiences and came up with the term 'relational overview' as a name for what is created when figures are included in conversations.  And then I made this model, illustrated through a hexagon pattern, to illustrate what I got and it became the basis for this website.

              The Family Dialogue Set was successful, but difficult to produce on a larger scale and quite expensive, and production ended in 2011.

                I continued to receive inquiries about the figure set and I developed a simpler but edition based on 2-D cards. It was easier and cheaper to produce, but more extensive.

                A former colleague suggested creating a digital figure set, suitable for young people who were well used to computer technology. She knew a programmer and I knew a graphic designer, and we started a project to design and build an app for tablets. A beta version was developed for tablets, but the platform it was built on became outdated and it had to be remade.

                The new sets were named People in my Life Figure Set and People in my Life Digital.
