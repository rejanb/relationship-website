                A dialogue is a conversation where two or more people exchange information, opinions and points of view with the intention of gaining better understanding and closer agreement.   It is well suited for counselling and systemic practice.  Dialogue depends on enough mutual trust to allow the participants to speak openly without fearing of ridicule or chastisement.

                <h5> <strong>Peopling</strong></h5>

                <p style="margin-bottom:0px"  class="text">
                These are dialogues arising from choosing figures, perceiving them as representing
                people, and then placing them to form a relationship overview.
                When someone has chosen a figure for themself they can at once be asked about how they see themselves.
                When they choose figures for other people they can talk about how they see them, get on with them and how they get on with each other.
                Having a figure to hold can help reflection over ‘what that person means to me and what I mean to them’. Pets and other significant animals can also be included.
                When figures are chosen to represent people, they facilitate the telling of stories.
                Once figures are placed on a table you can ask about where they are standing in relation to each other, how the people they represent get on with each other, what they do together, and so on.
                Where and how they are arranged tends to invite curiosity and it is a relatively small step to consider the point of view of another person.

            This kind of dialogue can address central relationship themes of attachment and belonging.
            <br>
            Enquire about:
            <br>
            Who they admire, who understands them, who gives them comfort and support, what history they have had together, and the parts they now play in each other’s lives. Whether there is anyone who they dislike, makes life difficult for them, hurts or frightens them and what they do to make things bad and about who they can turn to for help and protection.
            Whether there is anybody who is no longer present in their life but is still important to them. They can choose a figure for them too, and decide where to place them, while they talk about what they have meant to them and how they think about them now.

                <p style="margin-bottom:0px"  class="text">
                This is about considering the wider context and gaining fresh perspectives of how things could be different.
                In times of difficulty, people can easily over-focus on the day-to-day tribulations of their situation and lose sight of the larger picture.
                You might say that they cannot see the forest for all the trees and need help to elevate their vantage point.
                Surveying gives an impression of the configuration as a whole.  It invites dialogue about contextual aspects of their relationships and how the various parts are contributing to the whole.
                It invites reflection over the question “Who is in my life and how are they there?” and it can help identify resources that have been overlooked.

            When a situation is visualised, it appears less entangled and bewildering. A configuration can be viewed from different angles and the different vantage points can be talked about.
            Surveying a relationship overview can give an impression of how things are related to each other and bring a sense of order into situations that are experienced as chaotic.
            The impression from an overview can be summarised in just a word or sentence.

                     Relationship overviews are well suited for comparing and contrasting different situations and points of view.
                    Figures in a configuration are easily moved, and can show alternative perspectives that can be compared.
                    Making visual comparisons is a very effective way of facilitating dialog about agreement and disagreements.
                    They can give people a picture of another person’s point of view and bring fresh insight and renewed understanding.
                    They can bring some flexibility to stuck attitudes and rigidly held opinions.
                    Various perspectives can be configured, compared and the possibility for change can be explored in dialogue

              <br>
              Here are some of the kinds of comparison that can be made through different arrangements of a relationship overview:
              <br><br>
            <strong>Time - </strong>
                How things look now and how they looked then.
                This could also be before and after a particular event or situation.
                The dialogue can be about what are the differences, how they have come about, the implications they have had, what could have been different, what they have learnt from the change.

              <br><br>
              <strong>Hopes and fears – </strong>
                    How I hope they will be and how I am worried they could turn out.
                    Comparing how a person hopes things will turn out with how they are worried they may become.
                    The dialogue can concern the likelihood of each outcome and what turns of events could lead to the different outcomes.
                    What would be necessary to avoid things turning out badly? What would the implications be for others?

                <br><br>
              <strong>Ambivalence –</strong>
                 How things appear from different attitudes.
                Comparing how a person sees things from a positive, optimistic attitude and from a negative, pessimistic attitude.
                The dialogue could turn to how to develop and maintain a helpful attitude, who can support it and what and who would undermine it.
                This could also be from other contrasting perspectives such as ‘from my rational side’ and ‘from my emotional side’.
                <br><br>
              <strong>Someone else’s perspective - </strong>
                 How it looks for me and how it looks for you.
                Rearranging the relationship overview to show how a person believes that another person sees the situation (it could even be how the family dog or the fly on the wall would view things).
                Do you think other people would see this in the same way as you? Who would see things differently? How would they see it?
                <br><br>
              <strong>Family perspectives – </strong>

                In family sessions, each family member’s perspective can be compared to others.
                After a family member has set out the figures you can ask other family members to show whether they have understood their situation in a similar way or differently.
                For example, you can ask a parent to keep their child’s figure in place but move other figures to demonstrate how they have understood their child’s situation.
                Then you can talk about the differences and what they have meant.
                This can provide better insight into how they understand each other, how well they mentalise each other.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Alternative realities  – </strong>
                How it would look if the opposite was true, or if the impossible was possible.

                  A relationship overview can become an arena for exploring a person's social  situation.
                  <br>
                    Here are a few examples:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Genogram</strong>
                    <br>
                    Constructing a genogram and talking about the various aspects of the culture of a family is a very fruitful way of working on the understanding of alliances, and conflicts.
                    When a couple joins together, each brings with them a wealth of experiences, attitudes, loyalties, habits, understandings, duties, and narratives to the new relationship and they have a task of bringing these together, adding something new and forming their own way of living.
                    It can be very valuable to explore these various influences when helping them to manage areas of disagreement and conflict.

              <strong>Spectogram</strong>
              <br>
                The spectogram is a sociometric group exercise devised by J.L.Moreno as a way of researching social groups.
                Spectrograms are based on simple scales going from ‘Very Little’ to ‘Very Much’ where people place themselves according to their view or evaluation of a particular issue.
                Figures can be placed on a line on the table to illustrate how a person sees different people’s evaluation of particular themes and the dialogue can centre on various aspects of these evaluations.
                It can be used for showing and discussing something as simple as people's ages, or it might be their levels of feeling safe, certain, of a preference, an attitude or so on.
                The dialogue can continue about the reasons people stand where they are, the implications of their positions, the likelihood of change and so on.

              <br> <br>
             <strong>Emotional awareness</strong>
              <br>
                In a conversation addressing a person’s emotional awareness or experience, a drawn circle can be divided into segments, each labelled to an emotion.
                A person can then place a figure to show how intensely it was felt in a particular situation.
                This process can help in sorting out mixed and confused feelings, and differentiating between thoughts and feelings.
                There are several theories about which are a person’s basic emotions, with numbers ranging from six to over thirty.
                The most usual include degrees of Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Fear, Excitement, Tenderness, Disgust, Trust, Surprise, Vigilance and Contempt.


            <br> <br>
             <strong>Making a decision together</strong>
              <br>
              The segments of the coloured circle can be labelled to represent the various options in decision making.
                Family or group members can place figures to show each other their preferences and discuss the nuances of their reasons when they are making a decision together or understanding how and why a decision was made.

                Figures from relationship overviews can be used for illustrating and playing out events, situations or incidents significant to a person, their relationships and self-image.

                  <strong>Role play with figures</strong>
                  <br>
                    The figures can be used to demonstrate events and situations that have been important to the person, what they remember and how they experienced them.
                    They can be used to explore particular situations or incidents that are or have been significant to the person, their relationships and self-image through playing out how a person remembers the situation.
                    This would involve setting out the figures of the people involved to make a small scene on the table.
                    Small objects can be added to help set the scene. The situation can then be played out as a figure theatre to show how the person remembers it.

            A scene can also be played out again from another person’s point of view.
            In the ‘Playback theatre’ method a ‘repaired’ version of a situation is added, where someone or something intervenes and prevents it from turning out badly.
            This can help to take some pain out of a bad memory and reduce any unreasonable guilt and self-blame.
            If there have been issues for children at school, they can make a configuration of the pupils and teachers that were involved to talk about rejection, mocking, threatening and bullying in the classroom, playground or on the way to school.
            These stories are often hidden from the parents and teachers even when they have a good general understanding of the school environment.

            <strong>Externalising problems</strong>
                  <br>
                  Michael White and David Epston developed the narrative method of externalising problems.
                    An externalised problem can be represented in some way - by a figure, an article, drawn on a card, modelled in plasticine.
                    Figures can be used to set up and play out a scene typical for the dominant narrative where the externalised problem is causing difficulty.
                    Dialogue can move to situations that turned out better, who or what would make a difference and how to use this information to help tame the problem and regain control of one’s life.
                    <br> <br>



            <strong>Solution focus</strong>
            A scene can be set up with figures where a particular difficulty is no longer present and the person or family can talk about what life is like now, how relationships have changed and what is concerning the people now.
            The dialogue can trace back to how they managed to arrive at this situation. Whenever people set out figures they will be exploring as well as demonstrating their own perspective.
            There is a duality of statement and question ‘This is how I see it’ and ‘Is this how I see it?
            <br> <br>


            <strong>Role reversal with figures</strong>
            Role-reversal is a technique taken from psychodrama group therapy, where someone is guided into putting themselves in the position of another.
            They can begin by holding their own figure and asking a question or saying something to the other person.  They put down their figure and take the figure of the other person, focus their thoughts on how they would answer, and say a reply out loud. They swap to their own figure and say their own response. A dialogue develops through the continued swapping of figures and responses.  They are able to express things that have not been said at the same time as a glimpse of the other person’s perspective tends to come out.
            Role reversal is a powerful technique that requires experience and training.

                    A dialogue about what to do and how to do it, the changes a person wants to make and what will empower them.
                    People usually decide to go to counselling or therapy aiming to make some sort of change or wanting to get direction, although others around them may disagree.
                    From renewed understandings of relationship issues, dialogue can turn to applying and integrating change, utilising resources and collaborating to manage difficulties in ways that are constructive and mutually satisfying.
                    Changes are best made in dialogue, with deliberation, consideration and unhurriedly, not rashly, headlong and inconsiderately.
                    Dialogue can concern what does and does not need to be changed, what the alternatives are, how changes can be realised, how to deal with the implications and results of changes, and when and at what pace the changes are best made.

                Dialogue around a relationship overview can help lift a person from feeling victimised by their circumstances and can make them more aware of the power and influence that they can have over themselves and the people around them.

                    When a person sets out their own figures, they can become aware of aspects of their relationships and the way they think about them that they had not considered before.
                    A person’s perspectives and the implications they have for their relationships can be reconsidered in the light of new information from dialogue around relationship overviews.
                    In relationships it may well involve understanding another person in a different way.
                    People can make important changes in their lives when they begin to think and feel differently about their situation.
                    Re-viewing is about reflecting over the present situation and deciding whether it is tenable.
                    It can lead to accepting the situation as it is, or deciding to try to change it.
                    Reflections over fresh insights gained from relationship overviews help people to re-assess their attitudes, actions and understandings, reconsideration of the person’s perspectives and the implications they have for their relationships.
                    When a person talks out loud about their situation, they are not only talking to other people, they are also ‘talking to their ears’.
                    They hear their own voice rather than just thinking. There is energy in hearing your own words that creates a larger commitment to action.
